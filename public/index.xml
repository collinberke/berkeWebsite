      <description>Hello World! It’s time for me to start something new I have decided to start writing a blog. I have never attempted anything like this before, but I felt it was time to start organizing some of my projects and thoughts into one central location. For some time, I have really wanted a space where I could discuss things that I find interesting, both professionally and personally, and a place where I could further refine my thoughts.</description>
